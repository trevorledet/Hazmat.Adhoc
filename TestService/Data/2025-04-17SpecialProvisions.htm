</FP-1>
<FP-1>129 These materials may not be classified and transported unless authorized by the Associate Administrator on the basis of results from Series 2 Test and a Series 6(c) Test from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) on packages as prepared for transport. The packing group assignment and packaging must be approved by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety on the basis of the criteria in § 173.21 of this subchapter and the package type used for the Series 6(c) test.
</FP-1>
<FP-1>130 “Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.,” commonly referred to as dry batteries, are hermetically sealed and generally utilize metals (other than lead) and/or carbon as electrodes. These batteries are typically used for portable power applications. The rechargeable (and some non-rechargeable) types have gelled alkaline electrolytes (rather than acidic) making it difficult for them to generate hydrogen or oxygen when overcharged and therefore, differentiating them from non-spillable batteries. Dry batteries specifically covered by another entry in the § 172.101 Table must be transported in accordance with the requirements applicable to that entry. For example, nickel-metal hydride batteries transported by vessel in certain quantities are covered by another entry (<I>see</I> Batteries, nickel-metal hydride, UN3496). Dry batteries not specifically covered by another entry in the § 172.101 Table are covered by this entry (<I>i.e.,</I> Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.) and are not subject to requirements of this subchapter except for the following:
</FP-1>
<FP1-2>(a) <I>Incident reporting.</I> For transportation by aircraft, a telephone report in accordance with § 171.15(a) is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous evolution of heat (<I>i.e.,</I> an amount of heat sufficient to be dangerous to packaging or personal safety to include charring of packaging, melting of packaging, scorching of packaging, or other evidence) occurs as a direct result of a dry battery. For all modes of transportation, a written report submitted, retained, and updated in accordance with § 171.16 is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous evolution of heat occurs as a direct result of a dry battery or battery-powered device.
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(b) <I>Preparation for transport.</I> Batteries and battery-powered device(s) containing batteries must be prepared and packaged for transport in a manner to prevent:
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(1) A dangerous evolution of heat;
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(2) Short circuits, including but not limited to the following methods:
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(i) Packaging each battery or each battery-powered device when practicable, in fully enclosed inner packagings made of non-conductive material;
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(ii) Separating or packaging batteries in a manner to prevent contact with other batteries, devices or conductive materials (<I>e.g.,</I> metal) in the packagings; or
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(iii) Ensuring exposed terminals or connectors are protected with non-conductive caps, non-conductive tape, or by other appropriate means; and
</FP1-2>
