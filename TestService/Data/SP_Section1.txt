</FP-1>
<FP-1>130 “Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.,” commonly referred to as dry batteries, are hermetically sealed and generally utilize metals (other than lead) and/or carbon as electrodes. These batteries are typically used for portable power applications. The rechargeable (and some non-rechargeable) types have gelled alkaline electrolytes (rather than acidic) making it difficult for them to generate hydrogen or oxygen when overcharged and therefore, differentiating them from non-spillable batteries. Dry batteries specifically covered by another entry in the § 172.101 Table must be transported in accordance with the requirements applicable to that entry. For example, nickel-metal hydride batteries transported by vessel in certain quantities are covered by another entry (<I>see</I> Batteries, nickel-metal hydride, UN3496). Dry batteries not specifically covered by another entry in the § 172.101 Table are covered by this entry (<I>i.e.,</I> Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.) and are not subject to requirements of this subchapter except for the following:
</FP-1>
<FP1-2>(a) <I>Incident reporting.</I> For transportation by aircraft, a telephone report in accordance with § 171.15(a) is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous evolution of heat (<I>i.e.,</I> an amount of heat sufficient to be dangerous to packaging or personal safety to include charring of packaging, melting of packaging, scorching of packaging, or other evidence) occurs as a direct result of a dry battery. For all modes of transportation, a written report submitted, retained, and updated in accordance with § 171.16 is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous evolution of heat occurs as a direct result of a dry battery or battery-powered device.
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(b) <I>Preparation for transport.</I> Batteries and battery-powered device(s) containing batteries must be prepared and packaged for transport in a manner to prevent:
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(1) A dangerous evolution of heat;
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(2) Short circuits, including but not limited to the following methods:
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(i) Packaging each battery or each battery-powered device when practicable, in fully enclosed inner packagings made of non-conductive material;
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(ii) Separating or packaging batteries in a manner to prevent contact with other batteries, devices or conductive materials (<I>e.g.,</I> metal) in the packagings; or
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(iii) Ensuring exposed terminals or connectors are protected with non-conductive caps, non-conductive tape, or by other appropriate means; and
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(3) Damage to terminals. If not impact resistant, the outer packaging should not be used as the sole means of protecting the battery terminals from damage or short circuiting. Batteries must be securely cushioned and packed to prevent shifting which could loosen terminal caps or reorient the terminals to produce short circuits. Batteries contained in devices must be securely installed. Terminal protection methods include but are not limited to the following:
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(i) Securely attaching covers of sufficient strength to protect the terminals;
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(ii) Packaging the battery in a rigid plastic packaging; or
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(iii) Constructing the battery with terminals that are recessed or otherwise protected so that the terminals will not be subjected to damage if the package is dropped.
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(c) <I>Additional air transport requirements.</I> For a battery whose voltage (electrical potential) exceeds 9 volts—
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(1) When contained in a device, the device must be packaged in a manner that prevents unintentional activation or must have an independent means of preventing unintentional activation (<I>e.g.,</I> packaging restricts access to activation switch, switch caps or locks, recessed switches, trigger locks, temperature sensitive circuit breakers, <I>etc.</I>); and
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(2) An indication of compliance with this special provision must be provided by marking each package with the words “not restricted” or by including the words “not restricted” on a transport document such as an air waybill accompanying the shipment.
</FP1-2>
<FP1-2>(d) <I>Used or spent battery exception.</I> Used or spent dry batteries of both non-rechargeable and rechargeable designs, with a marked rating up to 9-volt that are combined in the same package and transported by highway or rail for recycling, reconditioning, or disposal are not subject to this special provision or any other requirement of the HMR. Note that batteries utilizing different chemistries (<I>i.e.,</I> those battery chemistries specifically covered by another entry in the § 172.101 Table) as well as dry batteries with a marked rating greater than 9-volt may not be combined with used or spent batteries in the same package. Note also that this exception does not apply to batteries that have been reconditioned for reuse.
</FP1-2>
<FP-1>131 This material may not be offered for transportation unless approved by the Associate Administrator.
</FP-1>
<FP-1>132 This description may only be used for ammonium nitrate-based compound fertilizers. They must be classified in accordance with the procedure as set out in the Manual of Tests and Criteria, part III, section 39 (IBR, <I>see</I> § 171.7 of this subchapter).
